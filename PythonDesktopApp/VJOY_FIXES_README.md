# 🔧 vJoy Steering Wheel - Complete Fix Guide

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

Your Python script receives correct WebSocket data from the mobile app, but vJoy wasn't responding in games or `joy.cpl`. **All issues have been identified and fixed.**

---

## ⚠️ Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **WRONG AXIS RANGE** ❌ → ✅

**The Problem:**

```python
self.AXIS_MAX = 0x8000  # 32768 - WRONG!
```

vJoy uses **0x7FFF** (32767) as maximum, not 0x8000. Using 0x8000 causes values to wrap around or be rejected.

**The Fix:**

```python
self.AXIS_MAX = 0x7FFF  # 32767 - CORRECT!
```

---

### 2. **WRONG CENTER VALUE** ❌ → ✅

**The Problem:**

```python
self.AXIS_CENTER = 0x4000  # 16384 - OFF BY 1!
```

For range 0x1 to 0x7FFF, center is (0x1 + 0x7FFF) / 2 = 0x4001

**The Fix:**

```python
self.AXIS_CENTER = 0x4001  # 16385 - TRUE CENTER!
```

---

### 3. **NO ADMIN CHECK** ❌ → ✅

vJoy often requires administrator privileges to function.

**The Fix:**
Added `check_admin_privileges()` that warns users on startup if not running as admin.

---

### 4. **NO AXIS VALIDATION** ❌ → ✅

Code assumed X, Y, Z axes exist without testing.

**The Fix:**
Each axis is now tested individually on startup with clear error messages.

---

### 5. **NO RATE LIMITING** ❌ → ✅

WebSocket updates could flood vJoy driver at 100+ Hz.

**The Fix:**
Added 10ms minimum interval (100Hz max update rate).

---

### 6. **SILENT ERROR HANDLING** ❌ → ✅

Axis update errors were logged but execution continued.

**The Fix:**
Errors now raise exceptions to stop execution - no more silent failures.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Option A: Use Fixed vJoy Version (Recommended)

#### **Step 1: Test vJoy Independently**

```powershell
# Open PowerShell as Administrator
cd C:\Users\Muzaffer\Documents\GitHub\SteeringWheel\PythonDesktopApp
python test_vjoy_quick.py
```

**What to expect:**

1. Script will move vJoy device through all positions
2. Open `joy.cpl` (Windows + R → type "joy.cpl")
3. Select "vJoy Device" → "Properties"
4. You should see axes moving: LEFT → RIGHT → GAS → BRAKE

**If axes don't move:**

- ❌ Check Configure vJoy → X, Y, Z axes enabled
- ❌ Run PowerShell as Administrator
- ❌ Reinstall vJoy driver

---

#### **Step 2: Run Main Server**

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
python main.py

# Choose option 1 (Start server)
# Or option 2 (Test vJoy again)
```

---

#### **Step 3: Connect Mobile App**

1. Open React Native app on phone
2. Enter: `ws://YOUR_PC_IP:5000`
3. Hold phone **HORIZONTAL** (landscape mode)
4. Tilt left/right to steer
5. Press gas/brake buttons

---

#### **Step 4: Verify in joy.cpl**

1. Windows + R → `joy.cpl`
2. Select "vJoy Device"
3. Click "Properties"
4. Tilt phone and watch axes move
5. Press gas/brake and watch Y/Z axes

---

### Option B: Use Xbox Controller Alternative

If vJoy continues to have issues, use the Xbox 360 controller emulation instead.

#### **Installation:**

```powershell
# 1. Install ViGEmBus driver
# Download from: https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases
# Install: ViGEmBus_Setup_x64.msi

# 2. Install Python package
pip install vgamepad

# 3. Run alternative server
python main_vgamepad.py
```

#### **Advantages:**

- ✅ No vJoy driver needed
- ✅ Works in more games (Xbox controller support is universal)
- ✅ More stable ViGEm driver
- ✅ Easier setup

#### **Mapping:**

- Left Stick X-axis → Steering
- Right Trigger → Gas
- Left Trigger → Brake

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Issue:** vJoy doesn't move in joy.cpl

**Solutions:**

1. ✅ Run PowerShell as Administrator
2. ✅ Open Configure vJoy → Enable X, Y, Z axes
3. ✅ Run `python test_vjoy_quick.py` to verify
4. ✅ Check Windows Device Manager → vJoy Device listed

---

### **Issue:** Works in joy.cpl but not in games

**Solutions:**

1. ✅ Check game settings → Enable "DirectInput" or "Custom Controller"
2. ✅ Some games require controller mapping setup
3. ✅ Try Xbox controller version (`main_vgamepad.py`) instead
4. ✅ Verify game recognizes "vJoy Device" in controller settings

---

### **Issue:** Steering drifts to one side

**Solution:**
✅ **Already fixed!** Center value corrected from 0x4000 to 0x4001

If still drifting:

- Reset device in Configure vJoy
- Recalibrate in joy.cpl → Properties → Settings → Calibrate

---

### **Issue:** "Device is BUSY" error

**Solutions:**

1. ✅ Close joy.cpl (Game Controllers window)
2. ✅ Close any other programs using vJoy
3. ✅ Restart computer
4. ✅ Run script again

---

### **Issue:** "Not running as Administrator" warning

**Solution:**

1. Close current PowerShell
2. Right-click PowerShell icon
3. Select "Run as Administrator"
4. Navigate to folder and run script again

python diagnose_vjoy.py
```

### **Check Windows Event Viewer:**

1. Windows + X → Event Viewer
2. Windows Logs → System
3. Look for vJoy driver errors

### **Reinstall vJoy:**

1. Uninstall current vJoy
2. Restart computer
3. Download latest from: https://github.com/njz3/vJoy/releases
4. Install as Administrator
5. Restart computer
6. Run test script

### **Try Xbox Alternative:**

If vJoy continues to fail, the Xbox controller alternative (`main_vgamepad.py`) is more stable and works in more games.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Enable Verbose Logging:**

In `main.py`, uncomment line in `update_steering_wheel()`:

```python
# Uncomment this line:
self.log(f"   [VJOY] X={steering_value:5d} Y={gas_value:5d} Z={brake_value:5d}")
```

This shows every value sent to vJoy for debugging.

### **Adjust Rate Limiting:**

Change update rate in `__init__`:

```python
self.min_update_interval = 0.01  # 100Hz (change to 0.02 for 50Hz)
```

### **Test in joy.cpl First:**

Always verify vJoy works in joy.cpl before testing in games. This eliminates game-specific configuration issues.
